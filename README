xml-broker -- XML-based Event-Broker
------------------------------------

This project implements a event-driven, service-oriented example-project. Services will register for certain events at a centralized broker. Upon recieving events, the broker will forward these events to all matching services via HTTP/Post-Request.

Inside this repository you will find an implementation of the broker and collection of some example projects to get started with programming clients and services that may register with the broker.

Since this project has been ported to Maven, building should be quite easy. Just download a current Maven version from http://maven.apache.org/download.html (>=3.0.0), extract the files to your favorite directory and add Mavens bin/ directory to your PATH.

Navigate to the root-directory of your local copy of the project and run "mvn package". All sub-projects will be compiled to jar / war files located inside the corresponding <sub-project>/target/ directory. 

For Eclipse "Maven Integration for Eclipse" (m2e) and "Maven Integration for WTP" should both be installed to make Eclipse Maven aware. After Eclipse is setup proparly, add the projects by using "Import..." --> "Maven" --> "Existing Maven Projects". Enter the path to your local copy of this project and you should see all subprojects listed.

   Have fun =)
